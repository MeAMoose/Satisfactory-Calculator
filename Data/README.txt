IMPORTANT!!

When adding new factories into factories.json, do the following
-Outputs for extractors are assumed to be Pure nodes.
-Set "priority" to true for all extracted resources.
-Set "alternative" to true for all alternative recipes.

Program will follow following hierachy:
Priority -> Alternative -> Normal (neither priority nor alternative)
